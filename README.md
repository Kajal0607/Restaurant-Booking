# Restaurant-Booking

This project is a simple restaurant booking system implemented in Python using `tkinter` for the GUI. It demonstrates how to manage customer bookings using a queue data structure. The system allows users to input customer details such as name and the number of people in the booking.

This project is designed to help understand basic queue operations (enqueue, dequeue) and how they can be applied in real-world applications like managing restaurant reservations.
